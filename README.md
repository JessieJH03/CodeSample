# Data Cleaning and Difference-in-Difference (DiD) Analysis
## Overview
This project demonstrates data cleaning techniques and Difference-in-Difference (DiD) analysis for evaluating policy impact. The dataset focuses on terrorism incidents, corruption levels, and political stability in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

## Features
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing and filtering datasets from multiple sources.
Data Merging: Combining datasets for comprehensive analysis.
Difference-in-Difference (DiD) Analysis: Assessing policy changes and their effects on terrorism and stability.

## Datasets
The project works with the following datasets:
- Global Terrorism Database (GTD) – Filtered for incidents in the MENA region since 2000.
- Corruption Index Data – Extracted historical corruption index values for MENA countries.
- Political Stability Index Data – Includes country-level stability measures related to terrorism.

## Key Methods
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, filtering regions, and standardizing column names.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing key trends in terrorism and corruption.
- Difference-in-Difference Analysis: Estimating the impact of policy interventions.

## Example Analysis
- Investigates the effect of U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 on terrorism incidents.
- Compares Iraq with similar MENA countries using DiD methodology.
